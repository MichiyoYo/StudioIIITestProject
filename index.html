                  <h2>What is a Prosthodontist?</h2>
                  <p>
                    A prosthodontist is a specialist who has received two to three additional years of education and training after dental school at an American Dental Association (ADA) accredited institution. He or she is a specialist of the art of treating damaged and missing teeth. The additional training focuses on mastering the techniques necessary to correct imperfect smiles.
                    <br><br>
                    Simply put, prosthodontists are the champions of mouth rehabilitation. Likened to a quarterback or an architect, a prosthodontist is the expert of a team that knows how to make your smile ideal and rehabilitate your mouth back to a healthy state again.
                    <br><br>
                    At Anacapa, you will be receiving care from among the best cosmetic dentists Oxnard has available. Our very own Dr. Jivraj was voted “Best of USA” by his peers, one of the long list of awards he and his partner Dr. Reshad have received over the course of the last two decades of quality care at Anacapa.
                    <br><br>
                    When it comes to your smile, trusting a prosthodontist is the wisest choice you can make. Seeing that many procedures in the field of cosmetic dentistry are better when done right the first time, putting your trust in someone who extended their training an additional three years and who is considered a master of mouth reconstruction is simply the smart choice.
                    <br><br>

                <hr>
                <p>
                  After receiving his dental degree at the University of Manchester, Dr. Saj Jivraj decided to continue his schooling to become a Prosthodontist at the prestigious Herman Ostrow School of Denistry at USC. There he mastered the art and skill of full mouth reconstruction procedures.
                  <br><br>
                  Dr. Jivraj is the former Chairman of Fixed Prosthodontics and Operative Dentistry at the USC School of Dentistry. He has published numerous articles on
                  cosmetic and implant dentistry in peer reviewed journals and is considered an expert in this field. He co-wrote the textbook “Treatment Planning in Implant
                  Dentistry” which is published by the British Dental Association.
                  <br><br>
                  He currently holds a position on the editorial board of the Journal of Esthetic
                  and Restorative Dentistry, and is the ad hoc reviewer for the Journal of Prosthetic
                  Dentistry, along with Associate Clinical Editor for Dental Teamwork magazine.
                  <br><br>
                  In addition to his two private practices in Oxnard and Woodland Hills, Dr. Jivraj also holds faculty positions of Associate Clinical Professor at the USC School of Dentistry, Clinical Teacher at the Eastman Dental Institute in London, and is on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Restorative Dentistry. With these positions, he not only mentors the minds of future dentists and
                  prosthodontists, but stays on the cutting edge of the field of cosmetic
                  dentistry and dental implants.

                        <h3>Sedation Dentistry</h3>
                        <p>Many people are so apprehensive of seeing a dentist that they would rather live
                          with an imperfect smile, a painful toothache or, worse, a dangerous tooth-related disease.
                          If you are among those who are anxious about seeing the dentist, Anacapa Dental Art Institute
                          has options for you so you can deal with your dental issues with little-to-no anxiety and maximum
                          comfort. Relaxing yet safe, sedation dentistry is a great option for those who cringe at the thought
                          of seeing a dentist.</p>

                        <p>Some patients have been concerned with the toxic properties of silver fillings
                           as well as the unnatural color they give your teeth. Whatever your reason for replacing
                           your silver filling, the experts at Anacapa are able to remove them safely and replace them
                           with biocompatible, tooth-colored alternatives.</p>
